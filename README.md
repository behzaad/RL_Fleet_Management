# Fleet Management via Reinforcement Learning

This repository is a sample implementation of [1]. 

Drones have been considered as an alternative means of package delivery to reduce the delivery cost and time. Due to the battery limitations, the drones are best suited for last-mile delivery, i.e., the delivery from the package distribution centers (PDCs) to the customers. Since a typical delivery system consists of multiple PDCs, each having random and time-varying demands, the dynamic drone-to-PDC allocation would be of great importance in meeting the demand in an efficient manner. In this paper, we study the dynamic UAV assignment problem for a drone delivery system with the goal of providing measurable Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees.
